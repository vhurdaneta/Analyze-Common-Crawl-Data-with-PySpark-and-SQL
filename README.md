# PySpark Project: Analyzing Common Crawl Data with RDDs
## Overview

This project demonstrates data analysis on large datasets using PySpark and RDDs. It's part of the "Introduction to Big Data with PySpark" certification from CodeCademy. Key steps include: 

## Code Structure

Initialization: Set up Spark and load data.

Preprocessing (RDDs): Format and calculate data.

Stop Spark: Terminate Spark.

Exploring Data: Use DataFrames for structured analysis.

Querying Data: SQL and DataFrames.

Filtering Data: Filter for specific information.

Closing Resources: Release Spark resources.


## Usage

Set up your Spark environment and dependencies.

Replace 'data/cc-main-limited-domains.csv' with your dataset path.

Run the code sections sequentially.

## Conclusion

This PySpark project simplifies big data analysis, focusing on common crawl data. Adapt it for your own projects. Reach out for assistance or inquiries. Happy coding!
